# test-mplus

- to run numbers 1-4, simply copy and paste the contents of the file into the javascript section at jsbin.com 
  and to see the results it can be opened in the console section
- specifically to see the results from number 5, you can copy the contents then run the 5.html file and the results 
  can be seen in the console
- for crud here I use mvc framework angularjs, but here there is only a part of my view and controller because I don't use a database. 
  And to see the results just open index.html in the angular CRUD folder
